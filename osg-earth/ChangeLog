	* Add building model source to the offline .earth file.

2017-01-19  Attila Torok

	* Added an offline tile source package, and corresponding omnetpp.ini
	configurations. Levels 16, 17 and 18 are to be added in later to
	release builds from an overlay zip.

	* Create the transmission animation procedurally.

	It is no longer loaded from bubble.osgb. That file has been deleted
	because there were many issues loading it, with different versions of
	OSG, especially finding the animation in it. The spheres are now faded
	too, and are animated manually in simulation time rather than "real"
	(wall-clock) time by osgAnimaion.

	  code in enabled state.

	* Moved movement trails off the ground to avoid Z-fighting glitches.
